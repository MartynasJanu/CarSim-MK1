** 4 passes **
* Energy (force, torque) pass
Calculates any energy sources that produce power of change
* Acceleraton pass
Converts energy into acceleration of change
* Speed pass
Integrates acceleration of change into speed of change
* Position pass
Integrates speed of change into change

** Component **
* Has inputs (also Components)
* Has outputs (also Components)
* Has Resources
* May accept resources from inputs
* May pass resources to outputs
* Has physical properties: mass, friction, etc.
* Has physical states properties: temperature, etc.
* May work in a cycle
* Different properties, resource acceptance, etc.  may be affected based on cycle state
* May convert Resources in certain cases (cycle state, Resource combination, outside trigger, time, etc)
* Can have arbitary functionality (output test data, etc)

** Resource **
* Has physical properties: density (can be temperature dependent)
* Compressability
* Method of ignition (if any)
* Melting, boiling point temperatures


** Considerations **
* Force/torque could be a Resource
